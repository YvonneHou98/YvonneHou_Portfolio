      <h1 class="display-4">Project Overview</h1>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Type-1 Diabetes patients live in a state of constant self-monitoring with finger picking, their daily lives subject to frequent interruption as a result of their health condition.</i></h4>
      <br>
      <h4><i>Given this, how can we better inform patients of their blood glucose level and reduce moments of stress to feel having more control on their lives?</i></h4>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>DDI team partnered with Dexcom, a company that develops, manufactures, and distributes continuous glucose
        monitoring systems for diabetes management. We aim to empowered diabetes patients
        community through ideate, interact with users, iterate, and improve, generating a clickable prototype at
        the end of the 7 one-week sprints.<br><br>

        All of our prototypes and design solutions are currently protected under <strong>NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement) </strong>and Dexcom needs one year to ship. Learn more on this <a href = "http://ddi.ucsd.edu" class="text-danger"><strong>official
          website released by Dexcom</strong></a> about our work & process.

        <h1 class="display-4">My role</h1>
        <p><strong>UX researcher,<br>
          Product Designer,<br>
          Most importantly, <a class = "text-danger">humble learner from the patients</a> in the area of diabetes</strong></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>

      <h1 class="display-4">UX Methologies</h1>
      <P>Our participants varied greatly in age, familiarity with the app, and familiarity with diabetes.<br>
      <p>Through research, we uncovered essential user needs and pinpoints that constantly inspire our design iterations. For instance, we noticed the user’s emotional need to preserve the overall original design they already attached to, in order to prevent users from having to readjust and accommodate to an unfamiliar user interface.</p>

      <h1 class="display-4">My Takeaways</h1>
      <p> • Designing for users in a field you don't already know is NOT intimidating. ( I once thought it is ) Unfamiliarity
        is actually a good thing, where you don't have any pre-existing assumptions to biase your design, and you have to approach
        users with complete UX research process: listen, empathize, and solve their problem with considerate design solutions.<br><br>

          • This experience triggers my interest in healthcare technology and how considerate human-centered design approach can facilitate
          user experience. Building technology with the warmth of humanity is fanscinating to me.<br><br>

          • I appreciate the resource Dexcom brought to us, allowing us to interact and test our prototypes on real-world users: type-1 diabetes
          recruited by Dexcom. Helped us give solution to reduce the technical support phone call volumn and improve the user troubleshooting experience.</p><br><br>
